			<h2> LEARNING PHOTOSHOP </h2>
			<article> I am not completely new to Adobe Photoshop, but
				having learned it by myself, I haven’t really gotten all the
				smart shortcuts and smart things to do. After watching the 5
				hour long Lynda course, I concluded that it was good to know
				all these things, but that there was no way I was going to
				remember all of them. It’s easier when you have it in your
				hands, and you have the time to play with it and figure stuff
				out yourself.
				<br>
				<br>
				As I mentioned, I have done some stuff in Photoshop before;
				spot removal, cropping, changing background, combining photos,
				creating fake snow. All this I have learned through Youtube
				tutorials, so I had a good basic understanding of the program
				and its tools.
				<br>
				<br>
				With this being said, it was nice to start from the bottom
				and move up from there. Walking through the basic tools on
				the class also helped understanding the last things, which
				I might have missed during the video course. And then just
				playing with it afterwards, refreshing what I already knew,
				was such fun. I also had great help in some of my classmates,
				who knew a bit more about the program than me.
				We had to do a little Photoshop project in class, and I chose
				the task to “merge two tv-shows and create a poster for it”.
				Of course I chose three, to challenge myself. The processes
				themselves weren’t that complicated, but I usually find my
				own way to do a task, even though it might not be the right
				or the easiest way. But broken down the image was made by:
				selection to layer, layer masks, making the top layer
				see-through in some areas, slight tone curve adjustments,
				and then adding the text in the right fonts.
				<br>
				<br>
				I’m already excited to try new methods and doing more
				Photoshop projects.
