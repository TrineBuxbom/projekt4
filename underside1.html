		<h2> FIRST BLOG POST </h2>
		<article> This is my first official WordPress post. I spend some
			time yesterday and most of this morning figuring out how this
			platform works but it’s only just now that I feel like I
			understand it. Now that I have my own website there really
			isn’t any limits to what and how I post. I feel like there
			should be, though.
			It’s still a work in progress and I feel like I’ll get there
			eventually when I’ve had some more time to try everything out.
			But so far I’ve managed to:

			<ul>
				<li> Make a subdomain </li>
				<li> Install WordPress </li>
				<li> Change the theme </li>
				<li> Add an ‘about me’ page </li>
				<li> Add photos </li>
				<li> Make my first post </li>
			</ul>

			I’m still not sure that I’m content with the theme and how the
			text looks but for now it’s more than an overachievement for me.
