		<h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
		<article> Welcome to my blog site. My name is Trine Buxbom and I
			am 24 years old and live in Odense, Denmark. This website is my
			first try at making an actual html website for the internet. So
			far it's going okay I guess. It's nothing big but so far it's
			working and that's what counts - I think.
			<br>
			<br>
			I am currently attending the multimedia design school in Odense
			where I obviously got this assignment. We're a class of around
			30 people who started February 1st this year. The education is
			gonna take 2 years to finish and hopefully by then I will have
			gotten a lot better at every apsect of media design.
			<br>
			<br>
			I also live in Odense with my boyfriend and have done so the past
			2 years. Work-wise I work at Ikea and have also done that for 2
			years. Besides that I have my photography business "Buxbom Foto"
			where I take portrait photos and occasinally do some music videos.
			With this design education I'm hopefully gonna be able to do so muh
			more according to my own business as well.
